PROBLEM: Cannot copy code from Cursor chat window
SOLUTION: Use one of these methods below

METHOD 1: Manual Creation
-------------------------
1. Go to your project folder: E:\My codes\cochin-aquatics-management
2. Create a new file called "index_new.html"
3. Copy this EXACT content into it:

[BEGINNING OF FILE]

2. Create new paste/pen
3. Ask me to provide smaller chunks that you can copy one by one
4. Combine them into the final file

METHOD 4: Email/External Transfer

1. If you have access to email or cloud storage
2. I can help you create smaller, manageable chunks
